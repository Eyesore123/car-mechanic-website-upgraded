# Car mechanic website upgraded

This is an upgrade to a car mechanic website. Compared to the previous version, this one is a whole lot better. You can see the previous version [here](https://eyesore123.github.io/car_mechanic_website/).

Tech stack used:

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Bootstrap
- Node.js - i18n package for internalization

Issues

- Button effect flashes for some reason.

Future plans

- A separate shop with its own domain or subdomain. Then user can use links to navigate between sites. Shop preview here:
