# Car mechanic website upgraded

This is an upgrade to a car mechanic website. Compared to the previous version, this one is a whole lot better. You can see the previous version [here](https://eyesore123.github.io/car_mechanic_website/).

Tech stack used:

* React.js
* Tailwind CSS
* Bootstrap
* Node.js - i18n package for internalization

Issues

* Button effect flashes for some reason.
* Background video should be smaller on larger screens but I'm too damn lazy and haven't adjusted it yet.
* Images load too slow, because I haven't done any optimization.

Future plans

* I have plans to add a shop. I think I'll add it on a different domain, and I'll make a button link which will redirect to the shop. Tech stack for the shop will by Firebase, Next.js, Node.js and React Redux. Or at least that is the plan.
